# Note-Taker

For this repo, I have created an express backend script that allows the user to create and delete notes on the front end UI. This script includes both front end javascript and express.js on the back end to have it all function properly. The server is run through a command line interface and hosted locally on a server.

This note-taking program works by having our user save their work to our server API which essentially saves their information to a file. The user has the ability to create as many notes as he or she likes along with deleting them individually or viewing them. 

In all this project incorporates html, css, javascript, nodejs and express.js.
